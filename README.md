# PyTorch Fundamentals Learning Path

Welcome to the PyTorch Fundamentals Learning Path! ðŸŽ‰ 

This course is designed to take someone with minimal machine learning experience and get them started on a path toward becoming proficient with the PyTorch open source framework.

## Course Outline

This course is going to be broken up into 3 sections:
- Basics about PyTorch's Tensors - the core data structure in PyTorch
- PyTorch core concepts and workflow
- Classification Neural Networks concepts with PyTorch


## Pre-requisites

To get the most out of this course, you should have some basic knowledge about **Python** (and, preferably, <ins>Jupyter Notebook</ins>) and some mathematics fundamentals, like basic **calculus** (linear, logarithmic and exponential functions, derivatives), **linear algebra** (vectors, matrices, matrix multiplication) and some **statistics** knowledge. That said, even if you're not totally comfortable with these topics, you can easily pick things up as you go along.

Having some machine learning essentials in your arsenal will also helpful as it'll make taking the course quicker for you, but they're not required. You'll be able to learn them throughout the course, as it is designed to learn machine learning by using and applying PyTorch.
